Attendance: all

Discussion:
	- Overview of project goals: make sure everyone understands what the project is.
	- Review of the dataset: what it provides, what we need, how we are going to process it.
	- Assignment of roles: who is going to do what.

Notes:
	- Push back research into scanner - we need to focus more on the actual contents of the project (algorithms, etc), rather than the fancy UI.
	- Dataset only provides ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number), which is a problem if we want to search the dataset using a UPC (Universal Product Code) from a barcode. 
	- After looking into ASIN to UPC conversions, we decided to try and use the Amazon Product Advertising API to lookup the ASIN given a UPC. The plan would be to use this API to convert the ASIN's in our dataset to UPC, and then use this updated dataset in out project. 
	- The original dataset doesn't guarantee a product to have a price, so it may be worth looking into getting a slightly different dataset, or possibly using an Amazon API to find the price for us. 

TODO:
	- Successfully convert all ASIN's to UPC.
	- Find a dataset of products that have ASIN/UPC and prices OR create our own.
	- Determine algorithms to use to process data.
	- Possibly work with Scanner libraries (optional).
