Group 1:

Attendance: all

Discussion:
	- How are we going to process the data? (9.4 million products, each with many fields of data - 3.1GB zipped, 11GB unzipped)
	- Plans for the scanner
	- Change in implementation (see notes)

Notes:
	- Merge sort seems like our best bet - it's stable and quick.
	- Our dataset might be too large to sort all at once - sort in tenths and save in individual csv files, and then merge those files one by one.
	- Implementation plan: scan UPC or EAN, search for corresponding ASIN using Amazon API, search dataset for ASIN.
		- Kind of uneccessary, since the API returns the data we need anyways. Because of this, we will treat UPC/EAN to ASIN conversion as a black box, only using the API to access information if an ASIN can't be found in our dataset.

DONE:
	- Built Amazon API scraper for retrieving ASIN's and UPC's.
	- Read data out of dataset with a Python script.

TODO:
	- Revise Milestone 1
		- Objectives and Scopes: what are the objectives? Mention file size problems.
		- Project Planner: the chart we already have.
		- Change roles to something more specific, include what they will do.
		- Specify methodology (agile).
	- Figure out how to trim our dataset.
	- Possibly work with Scanner libraries (optional).
